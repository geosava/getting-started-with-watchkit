# [Getting Started With WatchKit][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]

We are now embarking on a very new and exciting opportunity as iOS developers. We now have the chance to target a brand new platform: Apple Watch. As with any new platform there are new concepts to learn. Lucky for us, though, most of the knowledge we have gained creating iOS apps is going to transfer nicely into this space. Over the duration of this course we will walk step-by-step through the process of creating a real WatchKit app and touch on a number of new features and technologies. It should be a lot of fun!
